	        	The croARTia database is a valuable reference and information source for people interested in a multidisciplinary approach to investigation of art and other cultural heritage. It is designed as an open-access platform to assist experts from cultural and scientific institutions working with art, such as art historians, conservation scientists, curators, conservators and restorators, gallery owners, authentication experts etc, as well as students or anyone interested in a somewhat different way of looking at art. The database represents an attempt to digitalize and systematically enfold a number of different and complementary investigations performed on cultural heritage objects and to encompass them all on one place, interlaced within a single database. The emphasis here is on conservation and restoration works and related documentation, as well as associated scientific investigations on artworks. Furthermore, the database includes a catalog of investigated pure and mixed sample pigments (mock-ups), standards and reference materials, including relevant analytical results obtained using various scientific instruments and experimental conditions.

					The croARTia database is free. It is intended to serve as a central storage place where people dealing with cultural heritage can digitally store their work progress and upload relevant documentation and/or carried out investigations/treatments. The database has simple and advanced search 		options and the results can be used for later references. With this in mind, all the institutions and interested parties dealing with cultural heritage are invited to contribute to this project and make this database grow, because only with a large number of entries the whole cultural heritage community will benefit. The submitted entries can be made public, but there is also  an option to restrict access to specific entries ensuring that confidential data will remain undisclosed.
